#Project Sisyphus

Ok, *this* project Sisyphus is about creating a tester app that
monitors SimplePush connections to devices.

There's an outstanding bug with FirefoxOS devices where the TCP
connection fails after some time. This results in the device no longer
getting Push notifications.

This service forever pushes and screams when it can no longer.

So, yeah, the name seemed fairly apt.
